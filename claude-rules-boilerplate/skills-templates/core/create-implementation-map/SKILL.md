  Generate an Implementation Map from an Epic and its Stories. This skill computes implementation
  phases from the dependency graph, identifies the critical path, produces ASCII phase diagrams,
  Mermaid dependency graphs, and strategic observations about bottlenecks and parallelism.
  Use this skill whenever the user asks to create an implementation map, generate a dependency
  graph, compute implementation phases, identify the critical path, plan implementation order,
  build a phase diagram from stories, or any variation of "create a plan from these stories".
  Also trigger when the user mentions sequencing stories, finding bottlenecks in a backlog,
  computing parallel work streams, or building a roadmap from an epic — even if they don't
  use the phrase "implementation map" explicitly.

# Create Implementation Map from Epic and Stories

This skill takes the Epic and all Story files and computes the implementation plan: which
stories can run in parallel, what the minimum implementation time is, where the bottlenecks
are, and how to optimize team allocation.

## Why This Matters

Without a dependency graph, teams either serialize everything (wasting parallelism) or
start stories out of order (hitting blockers mid-sprint). The implementation map makes
the dependency structure explicit and computable — phases, critical path, and strategic
observations that inform sprint planning.

## Prerequisites

Read the following files before starting:

**Template (output structure):**
- `.claude/templates/_TEMPLATE-IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md` — The exact structure to follow

**Required inputs:**
- The Epic file (with story index and dependency declarations)
- All Story files (with their Blocked By / Blocks tables)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Build the Dependency Matrix

Read every story's Section 1 (Dependências) and the Epic's story index. Build a complete
matrix:

| Story | Título | Blocked By | Blocks | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

**Validation checks:**
- Every story in the Epic's index must appear in the matrix
- Dependencies must be symmetric: if A blocks B, then B must list A as blocker
- No circular dependencies (A→B→C→A is invalid)
- Root stories (no blockers) must exist — if every story has a blocker, something is wrong

If inconsistencies are found, fix them and note the corrections.

Add a `> **Nota:**` block for any implicit dependencies not declared in the stories but
functionally required (e.g., "STORY-009 provides configuration data that STORY-002 needs even
though STORY-002 doesn't explicitly declare it").

### Step 2: Compute Phases

Group stories into phases using the dependency DAG:

1. **Phase 0**: All stories with no dependencies (roots)
2. **Phase 1**: Stories whose dependencies are all in Phase 0
3. **Phase N**: Stories whose dependencies are all in Phase 0..N-1

Within each phase, all stories can run in parallel.

Create the ASCII phase diagram using box-drawing characters. Follow the exact style from
the template — `╔═╗`, `║`, `╚═╝` for phase boxes, `┌─┐`, `│`, `└─┘` for story boxes,
`├──→`, `▼` for arrows.

Each story box shows: ID + short scope description (max ~20 chars).
Each phase box shows: phase number + name + "(paralelo)" if multiple stories.

### Step 3: Identify the Critical Path

The critical path is the longest chain of dependencies from any root to any leaf.
Count phases, not individual stories.

Render as a simple ASCII diagram:
```
STORY-001 ─┐
            ├──→ STORY-002 → STORY-003 ──┐
STORY-009 ─┘                              ├──→ STORY-011
                 STORY-002 → STORY-010 ──┘
   Fase 0           Fase 1       Fase 2            Fase 3
```

State: **N phases in the critical path, M stories in the longest chain**.
Explain the impact: any delay in a critical path story directly delays the final delivery.

### Step 4: Generate the Mermaid Dependency Graph

Create a full `graph TD` with all stories and their dependency edges.

**Naming convention**: `SNNN["STORY-NNN<br/>Short Title"]`

**Phase coloring** (use these exact classDef values for consistency):
```
classDef fase0 fill:#1a1a2e,stroke:#e94560,color:#fff
classDef fase1 fill:#16213e,stroke:#0f3460,color:#fff
classDef fase2 fill:#533483,stroke:#e94560,color:#fff
classDef fase3 fill:#e94560,stroke:#fff,color:#fff
classDef faseQE fill:#0d7377,stroke:#14ffec,color:#fff
classDef faseTD fill:#2d3436,stroke:#fdcb6e,color:#fff
classDef faseCR fill:#6c5ce7,stroke:#a29bfe,color:#fff
```

Assign classDef by phase. Group edges by phase transition (comment with `%% Fase N → N+1`).

### Step 5: Create the Phase Summary Table

| Fase | Histórias | Camada | Paralelismo | Pré-requisito |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | STORY-001, STORY-009 | Infra + API | 2 paralelas | — |

Include total count: **N histórias em M fases**.

Add notes about transversal phases (QE, Tech Debt) that can execute independently of
business phases.

### Step 6: Detail Each Phase

For each phase, create a subsection with:

**Table**: Story | Escopo Principal | Artefatos Chave

**Entregas da Fase N** (bullet list of concrete deliverables — what exists after this
phase that didn't exist before).

Be specific about artifacts: class names, table names, endpoints, configurations, test
infrastructure.

### Step 7: Write Strategic Observations

These are the highest-value part of the map. Analyze:

**Gargalo Principal**: Which story blocks the most others? Why investing extra time in
it pays off. This is usually the Layer 1 core story.

**Histórias Folha (sem dependentes)**: Stories that don't block anything. They can absorb
delays without impacting the critical path. Good candidates for junior developers or
parallel streams.

**Otimização de Tempo**: Where is parallelism maximized? Which stories can start immediately?
How should teams be allocated across phases?

**Dependências Cruzadas**: Stories in later phases that depend on stories from different
branches of the dependency tree. Identify convergence points.

**Marco de Validação Arquitetural**: Which story should serve as the architectural
checkpoint before expanding scope? What does it validate (patterns, pipeline, integration)?

### Step 8: Save and Report

Save as `IMPLEMENTATION-MAP.md` in the same directory as the Epic and Stories.
Report: total stories, phases, critical path length, maximum parallelism, main bottleneck.

## Language Rules

- All generated content must be in **Brazilian Portuguese (pt-BR)**
- Mermaid node IDs and classDef names stay in English
- Phase names in Portuguese (e.g., "Fase 0 — Fundação")
- Technical terms: "critical path" → "caminho crítico", "bottleneck" → "gargalo"
- Story and phase IDs in English format

## Common Mistakes

- **Phase computation error**: Forgetting that a story can only enter a phase when ALL its
  dependencies (not just some) are in earlier phases
- **Missing convergence analysis**: When STORY-011 depends on STORY-003 AND STORY-010 from
  different branches, this creates a convergence point that deserves a callout
- **Generic observations**: "STORY-002 is important" says nothing. "STORY-002 blocks 6 stories
  and establishes the decision engine pattern that all Phase 2 handlers reuse — investing
  extra design time here prevents refactoring 6 handlers later" is useful
- **Inconsistent status**: If a story is marked Done in the matrix but Pending in the phase
  diagram, that's a bug
- **Missing leaf analysis**: Leaf stories (no dependents) are strategically important because
  they can absorb schedule variance. Always identify them
