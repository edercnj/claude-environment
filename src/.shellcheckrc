# ShellCheck Configuration for setup.sh

# Disable warnings that don't apply to setup.sh's style and requirements

# SC1091: Not following sourced files
# Disabled: setup.sh sources files that may not exist in CI environments

# Disabled: setup.sh intentionally uses unquoted variables in some contexts for globbing
# Example: iterating over generated files
disable=SC2086

# SC2181: Check exit code directly
# Disabled: Some exit codes are checked indirectly or as part of larger logic flows
disable=SC2181

# SC2155: Declare and assign separately to avoid masking return values
# Disabled: Variable declarations with command substitution are common in setup.sh
# Example: local var=$(command) is used intentionally
disable=SC2155

# Disabled: sed and awk are sometimes more readable for complex text transformations
disable=SC2001

# SC2034: Unused variable
# Disabled: Some variables are used in subshells or dynamically referenced
disable=SC2034

# SC2053: Quote the right side of = in [[ ]]

# Disabled: Some functions in setup.sh reference $1, $2 as optional parameters
disable=SC2120

# SC2178: Variable was used as an array but is now assigned a string
# Disabled: Some variables are reused dynamically in setup.sh
disable=SC2178

# SC2181: Check exit code directly instead of using $?
# Note: Already disabled above, but worth noting
disable=SC2181

# SC2207: Prefer mapfile or read -a to split command output
# Disabled: Used for compatibility with older bash versions if needed
disable=SC2207

# SC2231: Quote expansions in array subscripts
# Disabled: setup.sh uses dynamic array indexing
disable=SC2231
